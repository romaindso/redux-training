### Reference
The Spectacle core API is available at [https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown).

### Presenting

To present:

- Run `npm start`
- Open two browser windows on two different screens
- On your screen visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). You will be redirected to a URL containing the slide id.
- Add `presenter&` or `presenter&timer` immediately after the questionmark, e.g.: [http://localhost:3000/#/0?presenter](http://localhost:3000/#/0?presenter) or [http://localhost:3000/#/0?presenter&timer](http://localhost:3000/#/?presenter&timer&_k=wbyhif)
- On the presentation screen visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
- Give an amazingly stylish presentation

_Note: Any windows/tabs in the same browser that are running Spectacle will sync to one another, even if you don't want to use presentation mode_

You can toggle the presenter or overview mode by pressing respectively `alt+p` and `alt+o`.
